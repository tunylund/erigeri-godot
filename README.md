This project is a conversion of https://github.com/tunylund/erigeri from html5 game into a game using the godot engine.

The conversion was a way of evluating the state of Google Bard LLM as an additional aid for the learning experience of a new tool.

Read below for the results of the experience.

# Your friendly neighborhood LLM will help you learn faster

TLDR;
_AI tools  tremendously speed up the learning process of a new language and framework  by pointing to the right direction and providing personalized tutorials for the work at hand with no preliminary setup needs._



### How do AI tools support the regular development workflow?

It’s Christmas holiday and I finally had a moment of time in my hands to learn something new. I’ve always loved using simple games as pet projects for learning. This time around I embarked on this quest to figure out how to incorporate AI tools into my learning workflow.

I decided to take an old game I wrote in Javascript back in the day and convert it to Godot. I hadn’t used Godot or its particular programming language GDscrip before. So the objective of this task became:

* Learn a new engine, language and API
* Convert code from javascript to GDscript
* Convert games and graphics concepts from Web to Godot.

Normally - without AI tools - my approach would be:

* Skim through into the API docs
* Read concepts from the Manual
* For each concept I have to work with, look up a tutorial or two for an example
* Combine information from all the sources, write code and learn

This time around I added Google Bard to the mix. I haven’t used AI tools thoroughly before and I was quite skeptical of their usability. I didn’t have a plan on how I wanted to use it and I didn’t want to either. I just wanted something just as simple as Google as a tool next to the others. So I chose to not do any priming on Google Bard - I just opened a new conversation with it and started prompting as per need. It didn’t have access to my code and I didn’t give it any boundaries or constraints to support its decision making.

### What did I learn

**I would definitely use Bard (or similar) as an aid when picking up a new language or framework.**

Bard sped up the learning process massively. Almost all I needed for the task was provided by Bard and the high quality of Godot API and Manual documentation. Bard was always able to provide a great starting point for learning any concept and it replaced most needs for tutorials. You still need high quality API documentation to be able to browse for information. I don’t miss navigating various tutorials at all.


**It doesn’t replace professional knowledge.**

Obviously you still need to know what good looks like and why. You need to know what to query for and you need to adjust the results to your needs. Nothing new here. You do this anyway with any Google results.


**I would welcome my team to use LLM tools as part of the workflow**

I’m keen on experimenting how a team can speed up and exchange their learnings with each other. Can we share prompts? Are prompts better used just when working solo or are they good when pairing as well?


**It speeds up conversion projects massively**

Bard was incredibly good at converting from one language to another. Most of the gameplay code was finished within a very short amount of time by simply converting the pre-existing code to GDscript and then adjusting to the new engine manually.

I want to test whether a conversion of a legacy service from one language to another would suddenly be a project that I could safely recommend. In the past this has been too much of a time sink to recommend to anyone. However - if the cost is low - why not just-do-it™.


**The tool is usable out of the box - just as your friendly neighborhood search engine is.**

Interaction with Bard was very simple. It needed 0 priming and no IDE setup. I was able to use my clunky english and still get useful results. It carried just enough context from one prompt to the next and was able to be more and more context-appropriate after each prompt.

### Getting Started
Godot Manual and documentation is very well written, I was working with a 2d game and the basic “Your first 2d game” tutorial got me started well enough without any need for me to ask for help from Google Bard or even Google.

Understanding how to organize scenes and nodes in godot took a bit more effort of trying things out by hand. But even that was manageable quickly enough.

![Image of the godot project for the game](./readme-assets/erigeri-6.jpg)

### Sprites and Animations
The first thing I set to create after the project setup was to figure out how to create Sprite Sheets and animations in Godot. The Godot manual pointed me towards Sprite Sheets and they were straightforward enough to set up without additional help. However I quite early on began to need a test-game-scene just for displaying the animations. This led to the first prompt to Bard:

#### Bard helps with new code creation


> ##### Prompt
> _“Please provide a function in GDscript language that splits the viewport rectangle into 5 by 4 squares. The output should be a list of Vector2 components”_

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>


```GDScript
func split_viewport_into_squares():
  var viewport_size = get_viewport().size
  var square_width = viewport_size.x / 5
  var square_height = viewport_size.y / 4

  var square_positions = []
  for y in range(4):
    for x in range(5):
      var square_position = Vector2(x * square_width, y * square_height)
      square_positions.append(square_position)

  return square_positions
```
</details>


This is a boring function to write and I was happy to be given a ready made example. The result was good enough and I ended up using it almost as is, with just slight alterations to allow for more characters on the screen.



![Test scene displaying various character animations](./readme-assets/erigeri-2.gif)


#### Bard helps with Language conversion

I had created a function in the original game that would figure out interpolated tween-frames for each animation. Tween frames are the frames that exist between the animation key frames. This allowed the animations to be much smoother than my shoddy drawing skills allowed. I wanted to convert this to GDscript beginning with some of the helper functions:


> ##### Prompt
> _“Please convert these javascript functions to GDscript …_
>
```javascript
  function getColor(d, i) { return i < 0 || i > d.length ? TRANSPARENT : [d[i+0], d[i+1], d[i+2], d[i+3]] }
  function setColor(c, d, i) { d[i+0] = c[0]; d[i+1] = c[1]; d[i+2] = c[2]; d[i+3] = c[3] }
  …
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

> **Here are the GDScript equivalents of the provided JavaScript functions, incorporating best practices and addressing potential issues:**

```GDScript
# Define constants for colors (adjust as needed)
const TRANSPARENT = Color(0, 0, 0, 0)
const BLACK = Color(0, 0, 0, 255)

func get_color(data, index):
  if index < 0 or index >= data.size():
    return TRANSPARENT
  else:
    return Color(data[index], data[index + 1], data[index + 2], data[index + 3])

  func set_color(color, data, index):
    data[index] = color.r
    data[index + 1] = color.g
    data[index + 2] = color.b
    data[index + 3] = color.a
  ...
```

</details>

The language conversion results were incredibly good. Bard realized on its own that the array manipulation was specifically about colors and it ended up utilizing GDscript native classes for these functionalities. I hadn’t provided the constants for transparent or black colors, it figured them out on its own.

I was incredibly surprised by the quality of the language conversion and ended up using Bard for conversion of most of the code for the game. The results needed some adjustments and refactoring to fit the rest of the code but the speed gain from this good quality conversion was massive.

At this point Bard was really stepping up. It had figured out that I’m clearly dealing with a game. It gave me a personalized tutorial on simple concepts that almost worked as is out of the box. And its output was very clear and easy to read. It even provided helpful notes about the output - which I happily ignored. In hindsight - I should’ve read them too, I had to learn them eventually. 



### Collisions

After setting up the initial animations and graphics, the gameplay required collision detection. 

The original game had custom code in place to figure out collision rectangles from game assets depending on which animation frame is shown. However Godot has a very well defined collision detection engine. I wanted to use the original assets to figure out collision rectangles, and I wanted to use Godot engine to detect collisions.


![Different red rectangles in the sprite sheet provide collision information for the frame.](./readme-assets/erigeri-7.png)



I started prompting Bard with questions about how to use various Godot collision concepts:

#### Bard helps avoid following bad paths

<summary>Answer</summary>

> While you can't directly set the position of a RigidBody2D in GDScript, here's how to effectively control its movement:
> 1. Using move_and_slide():
> Ideal for movement with collisions:

```GDScript
func _physics_process(delta):
  var new_position = Vector2(target_x, target_y)  # Set desired position
  move_and_slide(new_position)  # Move towards the position, handling collisions
```

> 2. Applying forces:

```

</details>

Bard was able to point me at the right direction even here. You can’t set the position of a RigidBody2D in godot. You apply forces and let them play out by the physics engine.

    print("Collision with shape A")
  elif collider_shape == $CollisionShape2D_B:
    print("Collision with shape B")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

> Here's how to detect collisions between a RigidBody2D instance and a StaticBody2D instance in GDScript:
> 1. Attach an Area2D:
> Add a child node of type Area2D to the StaticBody2D node.
> This serves as a collision detector for the static body.
> 2. Enable collision monitoring:
> In the Area2D node's properties:
> Set Monitoring to True.

> 3. Connect to signals:
> In the script attached to the RigidBody2D node, connect to the body_entered or body_exited signals of the Area2D node:

```GDScript
func _ready():
  get_node("Area2D").connect("body_entered", self, "_on_body_entered")
  get_node("Area2D").connect("body_exited", self, "_on_body_exited")
```

> 4. Handle collision events:
> Define functions to handle the collision events:

```GDScript
func _on_body_entered(body):
  if body is RigidBody2D:
    print("Collided with RigidBody2D!")
    # Perform actions upon collision

func _on_body_exited(body):
  if body is RigidBody2D:
    print("RigidBody2D exited collision!")
    # Perform actions upon exit
```

</details>


With the above and the Manual I was able to figure out what components I needed in the game for collision detection. All I needed to do was to adjust the collision rectangle shapes for each frame.

Bard began to completely replace any tutorial needs I had. I started taking Bard results as starting points on what items to look up in the API documentation and then learning from Bard, API and the Manual - I had the Godot collision system quite quickly figured out. All I needed to do was to adjust the game setup to create the collision objects from the graphics assets I had available.

### Gameplay

The game is a simple 2d fighting game, with inspiration coming from a Japanese fight-sport - Taido. The code I had written used the language and mechanics the sport uses. Most of the gameplay code could be copied over as is after just a simple conversion to GDscript.

I found it interesting how Bard was improving the naming I had in my original code. Inclusivity and non-violence were clearly part of Bards decision making - It’s a fighting game so I can’t really avoid violence that much, but I do appreciate the sentiment.

The output is good enough, but it uses randi() to generate a random number, just to pick a random value from an Array. GDscript has this function in the array api already.

Bard was able to take the instructions and applied it correctly to any further code it generated.

The gameplay code was very quickly converted to GDscript. With Bard's help my work was finished much faster than I anticipated. I was very happy that I didn’t have to manually convert from one language syntax to another.



#### Bard helps find bugs

As the project was becoming more and more playable, I saw that there was a bug in the game. I was able to find the general location of the bug, but finding the exact issue was a bit of a mystery. I did eventually find it, but as an experiment I also asked Bard:


> ##### Prompt
> _“Can you explain what this function does:"_
```GDScript
func weigh_pass(rnge, o_data, i_data, adjacent_color_fn, tilew):
  print("weighpass of ", rnge.front(), "-", rnge.back(), " (", rnge.size(), ") using ", adjacent_color_fn)
  for i in rnge:
    if is_transparent(o_data, i): return
    var ic = get_color(i_data, i)
    var adjc = adjacent_color_fn.call(i_data, i, tilew)
    if is_darker(adjc, ic): set_color(diff_color(BLACK, ic), i_data, i)”
```

Bard gave a very thorough explanation of what the function does.


> ##### Prompt

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

> While I can't definitively identify bugs without context and testing, here are potential issues to consider:
> * Early Return with Transparency: The function immediately returns if a transparent pixel is encountered. This might lead to unintended results if specific processing is needed for transparent pixels.
> * Edge Cases: The behavior at the edges of the image (or data structure) might need special handling to ensure correct calculations and avoid index-out-of-bounds errors.
> * Adjacent Color Function: The correctness of the function depends on the accuracy of the adjacent_color_fn. If it provides incorrect adjacent colors, the results will be flawed.
> * Color Data Handling: Ensure that colors are handled appropriately in terms of data types, format, and manipulation functions. Errors in color operations could lead to unexpected results.
> * Loop Termination: Verify that the loop iterates over the entire range of indices as intended. If the rnge variable is not properly defined or used, some elements might not be processed.
> 
> Recommendations:
> * Review Function Interactions: Examine how weigh_pass interacts with other functions and data structures in your code. Ensure consistency and compatibility.
> * Test Thoroughly: Use various input images and scenarios to identify unexpected behavior or visual artifacts.
> * Add Logging or Debugging: Use print statements or breakpoints to track variable values and function calls during execution.
> * Consider Alternative Approaches: Explore different image processing techniques or algorithms if the current approach doesn't produce the desired results.

</details>

Again I was surprised. Bard pointed at the bug immediately - not with solid certainty - but the result was good enough to be useful to me. The bug was the early return statement in the function - I should've used `continue` instead to allow the loop to finish.



### Shaders

To differentiate between characters, I decided to write a simple shader that colorizes the edges of each character to their designated colors. The original game didn’t use a shader, but rather created individual textures in memory for each character color. Since we’re working with a proper game engine - I thought it would be only appropriate to utilize shaders for this functionality. For this I had to create new code.

This kickstarted shader setup without prior knowledge of how to do shaders in Godot. Now I knew what to look for in the API and Manual and how to set things up to begin with.

> Here's a GLSL shader that colorizes the edges of a texture with a defined color:

```GLSL

  vec4 tex_color = texture(TEXTURE, uv);

  vec2 offset = 1.0 / TEXTURE_SIZE; // Adjust based on texture size

  // Detect edges using Sobel operator

The function is a good starting point even though it does the wrong thing. Sobel operator didn’t seem to work as I wanted it to and Bard used SCREEN_UV, which was the wrong value for the color value lookup. 

But now I had a starting point and some example shader language code to begin with. Whilst I have written shaders in the past - I had completely forgotten about shader language and I didn’t know what apis were available when running shaders in godot. The above function doesn’t do the right thing but it did point me in the right direction and within 30mins I had my own shader written.
