Learnings
* Google Bard is good at
** Just start using it without any preparatory queries
** Converting from language a to b
** Creating the "boring" / scaffolding code
** Learning the context from the questions and applying it to further questions
** Applying given considerations to further queries
** Showing an example of how to do something in the given context
** Exposing parts of the library that are new to me
** Bard was able to suggest where there might be possible bugs
** The functions it creates tend to be good enough, whilst they can sometimes contain mistakes, it fits quite nicely into the workflow to correct any errors
** It renamed language used by my code such that it would be more inclusive to people who might feel vulnerable

* Google Bard is bad at
** Bard wasn't able to choose the best classes for some of the work (drawing for example)
** I had to specifically ask bard for a bug for it to highlight it to me
